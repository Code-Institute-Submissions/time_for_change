Problem - Changing dice roll to JQuery, adding two rolls together, number and value or text

Changed from 2 dies to one, makes it easier for inner and board not big enough to warrant 2

Put computer turns to Auto - but instantly happening, will look at trying to get a delay between functions.

Lots of testing moving round and things that were happening on certain squares to stop play. Found it was certain squares didnt have a "Carry on" Button screen showing, so nothing moved this on to the next player!
